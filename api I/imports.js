// the most important thing is to learn how to read the docs

// theres two important imports (i dont touch the rest)

import { } from "@minecraft/server"
import { } from "@minecraft/server-iu"

// only use the things that you need
// server-ui won't be necessary unless you are working with the ui system
// if an import is added it will be necessary to add the dependency to the manifest


// introToAPI will only cover the modules imported from server
