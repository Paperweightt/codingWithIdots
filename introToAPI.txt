so you know some js

ideally now you get in some practice with basic js

however i understand that its boring af to build something that only really ouputs into the terminal
    console.log is boring

lets get you started on api so you can start to really apply those js skills into mc
    to start off with
        console.log() -> world.sendMessage()
