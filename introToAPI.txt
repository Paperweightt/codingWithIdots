so you know some js

ideally now you get in some practice with basic js

however its boring af to build something that ouputs into the terminal so either learn web dev or console.log
    console.log is boring
    web dev?!?!?!?

lets get you started on api so you can start to apply js skills into mc
    to start off with
        console.log() -> world.sendMessage()
